# Clean Code concepts adapted for .NET/.NET Core

## Introduction

![Humorous image of software quality estimation as a count of how many expletives you shout when reading code](http://www.osnews.com/images/comics/wtfm.jpg)

Software engineering principles, from Robert C. Martin's book [_Clean Code_](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882), adapted for .NET/.NET Core. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing readable, reusable, and refactorable software in .NET/.NET Core.

Not every principle herein has to be strictly followed, and even fewer will be universally agreed upon. These are guidelines and nothing more, but they are ones codified over many years of collective experience by the authors of _Clean Code_.
